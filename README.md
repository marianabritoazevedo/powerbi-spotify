# Data analysis - Spotify

This repository aims to put into practice the knowledge obtained in Power BI training on the [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/) platform. In this way, a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) database was used with data referring to the top 200 on spotify between the years 2017 and 2021 to create a dashboard with several metrics referring to these songs and artists. 

The link with the dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ivannatarov/spotify-daily-top-200-songs-with-genres-20172021) or you can download the file `data.csv` in this repository.
